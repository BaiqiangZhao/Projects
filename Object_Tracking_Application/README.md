To run the object, you need to first run init-db.py and second run app_lab8.py. Then, you can open the website http://localhost:6543/ and select different objects you like to find and track. There are three objects: apple, banana, and pear. Once you select an object, the camera will start to turn and find the object which you selected. If the camera find the object, Web page will show " found " and the coordinates. If you click "save coordicates" button, the information will be saved to database.
